IQPlayer is an online audio player. You can use it by your browser or build to your OS binary using Electron.

Drag and drop files to play.
The newest version 0.5 introduced playlists.

To use on your machine, clone the repository and run a live server or use `npm start` to build the electron app.

To do:

- Fix scrollbar color flicker when scrolling with active song

- Add a settings page to configure player behaviour (e.g the position of new playlist elements - start or end?)

- Implement array shuffling (the code is done, it just needs to be placed in the playlist modal)

- Implement song/playlist looping
