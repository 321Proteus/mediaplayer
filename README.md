Welcome to SIMP - Simple yet Intelligent Media Player!
You can use it both as a desktop application (using Electron) and as a browser page.

To do:

~~- Fix the progress bar so sliding it changes the sone time~~~ done
~~- Add WAV, OGG support (SIMP only reads MP3 so far)~~ turned out that it actually does :)
- Add playlist logic (shuffle, next/previous song etc.)
- Add ability to parse ID3 tags from file (e.g. to display cover image)

  Feel free to contribute!
